## Problem 1
```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The variables in this data set include `r names(early_january_weather)`. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded were `r max(early_january_weather$temp)` and `r min(early_january_weather$temp)`. The average humidity and wind speed were `r mean(early_january_weather$humid)` and `r mean(early_january_weather$wind_speed)`, respectively. 

All the values for temperature are `r early_january_weather$temp`. 

All the values for humidity are `r early_january_weather$humid`.

The number of observations in the data set is `r nrow(early_january_weather)`, and the number of variables is `r ncol(early_january_weather)`. 

The average temperature recorded is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.
