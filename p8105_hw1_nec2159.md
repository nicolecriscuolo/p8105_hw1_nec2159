## Problem 1

The variables in this data set include origin, year, month, day, hour,
temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
visib, time_hour. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded were
57.92 and 24.08. The average humidity and wind speed were 65.4767039 and
8.2258269, respectively.

All the values for temperature are 39.02, 39.92, 37.94, 41, 39.2, 37.04,
35.96, 33.98, 33.08, 32, 30.02, 28.94, 28.04, 26.96, 26.06, 24.98,
24.08, 30.92, 35.06, 42.08, 42.98, 44.06, 33.8, 37.4, 46.04, 46.94,
48.02, 44.96, 48.92, 50, 46.4, 44.6, 48.2, 51.08, 51.8, 51.98, 53.6,
55.94, 57.92, 57.02, 55.04, 53.06.

All the values for wind speed are 10.35702, 8.05546, 11.5078, 12.65858,
14.96014, 13.80936, 16.11092, 9.20624, 18.41248, 6.90468, 3.45234,
17.2617, 5.7539, 4.60312, 20.71404, 24.16638, 21.86482, 0.

The number of subjects in the data set is 358, and the number of
variables is 15.

The average temperature recorded is 39.5821229.

``` r
temp_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes (x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
temp_plot
```

The plot’s peaks and valleys show how temperature was changing
throughout the hours of each day. The gradual increase from January 1st
to January 14 show that the average temperature throughout the day was
increasing each day for these two weeks. After January 14, there was a
large drop in temperature. The humidity seemed to increase with
temperature for the most part as there was the most humidity around
January 13 and 14 and the least around January 3.

## Problem 2

``` r
example_df = 
  tibble(
    random_samp = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = random_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Nicole", "and", "I", "go", "to", "Columbia", "University"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("good", "good", "good", "alright", "alright", "alright", "alright", "bad", "bad", "bad"))
)

random_samp <- example_df %>% pull(random_samp)
mean(random_samp)
```

    ## [1] -0.1709484

``` r
greater_0 <- example_df %>% pull(greater_0)
mean(greater_0)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
vec_char <- example_df %>% pull(vec_char)
mean(vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(vec_char): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
vec_factor <- example_df %>% pull(vec_factor)
mean(vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(vec_factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I am able to take the mean of the random sample variable since this is a
numeric variable in addition to the “greater than 0” variable since this
is a logical variable. The other two variables are categorical, so I
cannot take their means.

``` r
greater_0_numeric <- as.numeric(greater_0)
greater_0_numeric

vec_char_numeric <- as.numeric(vec_char)
vec_char_numeric

vec_factor_numeric <- as.numeric(vec_factor)
vec_factor_numeric
```

The logical and factor variables get converted to numbers. This makes
sense as these variables have a limited number of possible responses.
For example, the factor variable responses of “good,” “alright,” and
“bad,” can easily be assigned number values, as can “True” or “False”
for the logical variable. This would not make sense to do with the
character variables as there are an unlimited number of possible
responses. This explains why I was not able to take the mean of the
character variable or factor variable. However, I was able to take the
mean of the logical greater than 0 variable as they had already been
assigned either “1” or “0” based on whether they were “True” or “False.
